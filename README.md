Pizza Challenge - UI focus

<hr></hr>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ðŸŽ¨ Design inspiration

I cannot design something completely new from scratch for two good reasons:

<ol>
<li>it would take too much time</li>
<li>I am a developer</li>
</ol>

So I decided to make this more of a real life example, where I would have design to follow and did a deep dive into dribble, behance and pinterest for inspirations. I dicided to use this [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/81662745/Website-Header-Concept-Designs), because it matched the wizard-like app, I wanted to create.

At first I thought about using a react ui component libraries, like Evergreen, but eventually decided to create my components myself, because I wanted full control over their behaviour and I only needed a very limited amount of elements. (Also I really disliked the look of most of those libraries ðŸ¤«)

Because I wanted to use some nice animations, I replaced the photo with this [pizza illustration](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/pizza-slice-background_1168758.htm#page=1&query=pizza&position=46) from freepik.

## ðŸ’» Implementation

I used several npm modules:

[react-step-wizard](https://github.com/jcmcneal/react-step-wizard#readme): Offers a simple API to quickly create a wizard

[react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet): Component based handling of changes to the document head tag

[styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/): Well you know styled components
