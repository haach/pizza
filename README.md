Pizza Challenge - UI focus

<hr></hr>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ðŸŽ¨ Design inspiration

I cannot design something completely new from scratch for two good reasons:

<ol>
<li>it would take too much time</li>
<li>I am a developer</li>
</ol>

So I decided to make this more of a real life example, where I would have design to follow and did a deep dive into dribble, behance and pinterest for inspirations. I dicided to use this [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/81662745/Website-Header-Concept-Designs), because it matched the wizard-like app, I wanted to create.

At first I thought about using a react ui component libraries, like Evergreen, but eventually decided to create my components myself, because I wanted full control over their behaviour and I only needed a very limited amount of elements.

Because I wanted to use some nice animations, I replaced the photo with this [pizza illustration](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/pizza-slice-background_1168758.htm#page=1&query=pizza&position=46) from freepik. The (pizza mockup)[https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/colorful-round-tasty-pizza_3799722.htm] that i used for the creator is also from freepik. The challenge right away reminded me of this game I had in the early 2000s, [pizza connection 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/599000/Pizza_Connection_2/). As a little homage, I wanted the pizza creator to go bit into that direction. The [tiny icon](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=pizza&i=1746127) for the size collection is from noun project.

## ðŸ’» Implementation

I used several npm modules:

[react-step-wizard](https://github.com/jcmcneal/react-step-wizard#readme): Offers a simple API to quickly create a wizard

[react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet): Component based handling of changes to the document head tag

[styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/): Well you know styled components

### What I did not do

But would do in real life:

- write tests
- create more mudolar components / use component library
- write animations using a framework instead of keyframes & optimize them
- fetch sizes & toppings from backend
- store all data in backend instead of local storage
- group identical items in cart
- have better validation in forms for input types
- have actual request error handling
- prevent user from navigating via #hash to all steps
- not have hard coded text
- make responsive
- make browser & device compatible
- have a favicon
